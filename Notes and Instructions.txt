Core Genetic Components

Allele Dictionary (Fixed Set)

Use known coat color loci: E, K, A, B, D, M, H, S.

Each locus has a fixed set of alleles (e.g., E = {E, Em, e}, K = {KB, kbr, ky}).

No need to simulate new mutations (optional feature).


Punnett Square (Theory)

Shows all possible genotypes & probabilities for a given locus.

Good for understanding the math of inheritance.

Example: E/e Ã— E/e â†’ 25% EE, 50% Ee, 25% ee.


Monte Carlo Simulation (Practice)

Runs randomized mating for many offspring.

Produces realistic probabilities across all loci together.

Example: simulate 100 pups â†’ 42% black, 38% sable, 20% merle.

Validates Punnett results on a larger scale.

ðŸ”¹ UI/UX Design with Pygame

Start Screen

Select Parent 1 and Parent 2 breeds.

Option to manually set alleles.


Genetics Panel

Show parentsâ€™ allele configuration per locus.

Drop-downs or buttons to select alleles.


Punnett View (Single Locus)

Display 2Ã—2 or 4Ã—4 Punnett square.

Show exact probabilities for that locus.


Monte Carlo Simulation Panel

Run a simulation of N pups.

Visualize pups (colored dots or icons).

Show phenotype frequencies (pie chart or bar graph).


Comparison Mode

Side-by-side view:

Punnett (theoretical) vs Monte Carlo (simulated).

Helps users see how math translates into real outcomes.
